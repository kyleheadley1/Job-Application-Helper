About This Role
In person, NYC. We work together in the New York City area, with hybrid flexibility.

Be our in-house scout on AI-powered software development

Qualifications
Genuine fluency and excitement for modern AI coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, etc.)

What Success Looks Like
Twelve months in:

You're the team's go-to authority on AI-assisted development — everyone ships faster because of workflows you found or built.
